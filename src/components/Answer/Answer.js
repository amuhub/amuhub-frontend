                    Django officially supports the following databases:

                        PostgreSQL
                        MariaDB
                        MySQL
                        Oracle
                        SQLite

                    There are also a number of database backends provided by third parties.

                    Django attempts to support as many features as possible on all database backends. However, not all database backends are alike, and weâ€™ve had to make design decisions on which features to support and which assumptions we can make safely.

                    This file describes some of the features that might be relevant to Django usage. It is not intended as a replacement for server-specific documentation or reference manuals.
